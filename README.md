# Shopify App Examples

This repository is home to the code examples highlighted in various [Shopify API tutorials](http://docs.myshopify.io/api/tutorials/). They are designed solely for the purposes of introducing new developers to the Shopify API. The example apps are written in [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra), but the concepts presented will also apply to developers building applications in other languages such as Python, Node.js and PHP.

## Tutorial index

#### 01 Getting Started
- Building a public Shopify application ([tutorial](https://help.shopify.com/api/tutorials/building-public-app))

#### 02 - Adding billing to your app
- Adding billing to your app ([tutorial](https://help.shopify.com/api/tutorials/adding-billing-to-your-app/))

## Requirements

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) (sample apps were written with Ruby 2.2.1)
* [Bundler for Ruby](http://bundler.io/), a dependency manager
* [Shopify Partners account](https://developers.shopify.com/)

## Credentials

Follow [this guide](https://help.shopify.com/api/guides/api-credentials#generate-public-app-credentials) to obtain your public app credentials from your Shopify Partners account.

This example apps use a `.env` file to store app credentials. After cloning the repository, you will need to create a file named .env in the same folder of the tutorial. Copy the values of the API Key and API Secret from your partner dashboard, and add them to the .env file in the following format:

```
API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
API_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

where `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` are the values of your application's API key and secret key respectively.

## App URL

This tutorial series uses [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a secure tunnel from the internet to your local machine. For each installment in the series, you will need to copy the `APP_URL` generated by ngrok to your `app.rb` file.  Additionally, the `APP_URL` needs to be added to the **App URLs** section of your public app settings.  These procedures are covered in the [Building a public Shopify application](http://docs.myshopify.io/api/tutorials/building-public-app/#configure-app) tutorial.

## Running the app

``` sh
# navigate to the correct tutorial
$ cd 01\ Getting\ Started/
# create the .env and copy your API key and API secret values
$ echo $'API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY\nAPI_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_KEY' >.env
# install dependencies
$ bundle install
# run the app
$ ruby app.rb
```
